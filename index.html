<p>V-USB based Electronics board for Arcade controls</p>

<h1>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>V-USB based USB Interface emulating a mouse, keyboard and gamepad with full configuration of button mapping (no drivers required)</li>
<li>4 way digital joystick + 7 button connections. 4 way joystick inputs can also be used for analogue joystick.</li>
<li>16 LED output pins (max current total 200mA) which can also be used as inputs. And 8 are also mapped wired to 1A higher power outputs with external power supply (optional hardware)</li>
<li>RFM12 wireless transiever (optional hardware) allows communication with other controllers and building of wireless controllers with 2 boards.</li>
<li>Full open-source hardware &amp; open-source software - Build with Free-Open-Source tools (KiCAD &amp; AVR-GCC)</li>
<li>ISP header to program the AVR (reset line can be cut and re-wired to have the board function as an programmer on the same header)</li>
<li>USB-micro or USB-B connector depending on your taste</li>
<li>Different small board designs, depending on your requirements:

<ul>
<li>100x50mm: Fully featured, has option for 16 LED outputs, of which 8 can be configured for high power. Has wireless RFM12 option. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs</li>
<li>50x50mm: Only base features with screw connectors. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs.</li>
<li>50x25mm: Only base features with pin connectors. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs </li>
<li>25x25mm: Only base features with pin connectors, components on both sides. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs </li>
</ul>
