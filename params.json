{"name":"Arcadeelectronics","tagline":"V-USB based Electronics board for Arcade controls","body":"ArcadeElectronics\r\n=================\r\n\r\nV-USB based Electronics board for Arcade controls\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n* V-USB based USB Interface emulating a mouse, keyboard and gamepad with full configuration of button mapping (no drivers required)\r\n* 4 way digital joystick + 7 button connections. 4 way joystick inputs can also be used for analogue joystick.\r\n* 16 LED output pins (max current total 200mA) which can also be used as inputs. And 8 are also mapped wired to 1A higher power outputs with external power supply (optional hardware)\r\n* RFM12 wireless transiever (optional hardware) allows communication with other controllers and building of wireless controllers with 2 boards.\r\n* Full open-source hardware & open-source software - Build with Free-Open-Source tools (KiCAD & AVR-GCC)\r\n* ISP header to program the AVR (reset line can be cut and re-wired to have the board function as an programmer on the same header)\r\n* USB-micro or USB-B connector depending on your taste\r\n* Different small board designs, depending on your requirements:\r\n\t* 100x50mm: Fully featured, has option for 16 LED outputs, of which 8 can be configured for high power. Has wireless RFM12 option. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs\r\n\t* 50x50mm: Only base features with screw connectors. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs.\r\n\t* 50x25mm: Only base features with pin connectors. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs \r\n\t* 25x25mm: Only base features with pin connectors, components on both sides. 4 direction inputs, 7 button inputs \r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n============\r\nThe following directories are in this project:\r\n* Electronics - Contain the KiCAD design files\r\n* Software/firmware/bootloader - Modified HIDBoot\r\n* Software/firmware/arcade - Main firmware for the Arcade controller\r\n* Software/computer/commandline - Commandline application to change the controller configuration, and control the LEDs\r\n* Software/computer/lib - Library shared between different applications for custom commands to the ArcadeController\r\n* Software/computer/gui_test - SDL based application to verify the Keyboard/Joystick/Mouse inputs\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
